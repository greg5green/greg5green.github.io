excerpt: <em>Young Adult</em> is not a comedy. Yes, there are some funny bits, but it’s really more of a drama about a selfish psychopathic alcoholic that comes barreling back into her hometown in an attempt to win back an old flame. I didn’t realize it until looking back at it now, but that plotline sure sounds pretty similar to <em>Funny People</em>’s doesn’t it?

*Young Adult* is not a comedy. Yes, there are some funny bits, but it’s really more of a drama about a selfish psychopathic alcoholic that comes barreling back into her hometown in an attempt to win back an old flame. I didn’t realize it until looking back at it now, but that plotline sure sounds pretty similar to *Funny People*’s doesn’t it?

Charlize Theron and Patton Oswalt are awesome in their roles as characters that were on opposite sides of the high school social spectrum but become unlikely friends. It’s probably a function of him being typecast as a funny guy in my mind, but I am always amazed at Oswalt’s range when he is in a serious role.

Just like *Funny People*, the actions of some of the characters make the viewer uncomfortable. Unfortunately, outside of Theron and Oswalt, there isn’t enough redeeming value to make this movie enjoyable. One important measure for me when looking back at a film is to see if I felt my time and/or money were wasted. If you only look at that measure, this film passes, but I can’t wholehearted recommend it.

**Rating:** 2.5 out of 5
