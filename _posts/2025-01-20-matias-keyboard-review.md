title: Matias Keyboard Review

This is going to be short and sweet -- the Mathias keyboard is not a replacement for the Apple Extended Keyboard II.

I'm not sure why it gets "promoted" that way online. Maybe it's because the Alps switches I'm used to are from an original AEK2 and are 30 years old by now? (I bought mine used on eBay) They're more worn out so they're smoother?

These Alps switches also aren't at all quiet. My Das Keyboards with Cherry MX Blues are quieter by a HUGE margin.

Based on reviews, I thought I was getting the holy grail of keyboards, but in reality, it's just a keyboard that is going to live in the garage unless I break 3 other keyboards.

I'll just be going back to the Das Keyboard or my original AEK2, but with the "Wombat" adapter I recently bought instead of the old ADB-USB1 adapter I got off eBay years ago.
