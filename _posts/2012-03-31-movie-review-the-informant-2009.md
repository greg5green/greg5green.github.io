This rainy Saturday afternoon, I decided I should finally dig into the pile of Netflix movies I've had sitting on the shelf for the last few months. I chose to sit down with *The Informant*. I walked away unimpressed.

I sat down expecting a comedy, but I'm not sure if that's the right classification of this film. As it starts, you catch a feeling that this is going to be a quirky, indie type of movie (maybe similar to Extract, but that might just be because they both deal with corporate espionage a little bit), but that never fully develops. None of the characters are particularly likable and none end up being fully fleshed out. The closest you get to a fully developed character is the title character, Mark Whitacre, but his changing personality/inconsistent behavior makes him tough to figure out. I think his inconsistent behavior might be the cause of my distate for *The Informant*â€”his actions just grew tiresome towards the end.

It wasn't all bad though: Matt Damon did a great job acting out Mark Whitacre's neuroses.

**Rating:** 2 out of 5
