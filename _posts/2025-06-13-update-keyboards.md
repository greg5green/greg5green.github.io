So, my last post was about how I hated the Matias Keyboard. I had to re-evaluate. I looked at what I was looking for in a keyboard and what I was willing to accept.

I realized I loved the wireless functionality of whatever bluetooth Apple keyboard I had. I realized I loved having some soft touch mechanical keys, like the AEK2. I realized I didn't care if I had a number pad or not -- it rarely got used.

I also realized that I'd love something that was wireless and could be shared easily between my personal MacBook Air, my work MacBook Pro, and the SFF PC I recently built (maybe I'll post about that soon). I started looking and ended up on something that would be easy to return if I needed to -- the [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://a.co/d/86mjkvx) (not an affiliate link, just linking in case you were curious. But there's probably some Amazon tracking in there, because Amazon does Amazon).

So far, it fits all my needs. It's wireless, I can easily switch between my different computers, and it has a nice typing touch. It's also quiet and has different backlit settings so when you're typing, it isn't in your face, but if you move your hands away and then get ready to hit a key again, the backlight increases in brightness.

I do really like this keyboard, but I bought the Mac version, so I struggle a little bit with switching between Windows, Linux, and macOS. I have been thinking about remapping things, but it gets a little easier each time I switch between platforms. If I bought the PC version, I would struggle the opposite way.

I recently ordered a 34" ultra-wide monitor that has a KVM built-in (waiting for FedEx as we speak), so I might re-evaluate in a few weeks and go back to a wired keyboard, but I'm pretty happy with this one and don't see myself changing at the moment. Switching to a wired keyboard wouldn't really help any of my "issues".
