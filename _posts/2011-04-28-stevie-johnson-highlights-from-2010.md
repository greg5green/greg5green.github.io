In light of the NFL Draft starting tonight, I thought I would provide you with some Stevie (Styles) Johnson highlights from last year. This kid came out of Kentucky in the 7th round. He was someone that fans who *really* followed the team *really* wanted to get more repetitions throughout the Dick Jauron years but he didn't get them until Chan Gailey came in and installed his new system. Johnson had a breakout year and he's going to have a bright future with the Bills (we hope anyways). I just wish they hadn't ended with that drop...
